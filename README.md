# Fledgeling
Fledgeling is a project mock of Kickstarter, where designers can submit their ideas to the platform for the general public to support.
A designer can add pledge tiers to their project, where they can offer a reward for supporters who donated money to their company early.
Supporters can also directly support a project with donations.
